1st game in the game a week challenge.I'm still learning so the code isn't very good in alot of places overwise if you have comments and/or questions feel free to ask.


What was my goal?
-finish the game on time
-get familiar with coding with a entity component system
-come up with interesting enemy behavior
What went right?
-Have a better understanding of the scope i need to aim for every week
What went wrong?
-spent to much time on experimenting and making enemy behaviors and not enough time making the game.
-game feature management was bad. should have spend more time on making the shooting and enemy interactions fun.
-code was too messy at parts
Final Thoughts
-have a better perspective :on what it takes to finish a game, where I should focus on and on writing code to work better.
